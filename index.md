# Questions and Answers
1. Are there ways to gain supporters rather than by Gatcha?
    - Yes, do the seasonal events. Once you get the top prize, which is the supporter, then reset it and keep going up to 10 times. Every other time is a Gatcha token.

2. Are there ways to gain gems?
    - Yes, do the events and quests that are new. You get 10 gems for each new one you clear.
    - Max out intimacy level of supporters
    - Complete weekly quests for 60 gems

3. Are there other ways to obtain characters than by the store?
    - Yes, there are seasonal events where you can obtain characters. An example is when they release characters for Ingrid vs Osaki.

4. Is there a way to try a character before you buy?
    - Unfortunately, no there is not.

5. How can I increase my gold currencies?
    - You can do the side quests that involve gold ingots. Sell those for increase gold currencies.

6. Who is your favorite character?
    - Kurenai and Emily

7. Who is your least favorite character?
    - Astaroth, JingLei and Murasaki.
    - I regret buying these characters
    - JingLei is more of a beatem-up fighter but this game is hack and slash.
    - Murasaki is too slow for my playstyle. Maybe it will fit your style of play.
    - Astaroth is a poor man's version of Emily without the homing feature.

8. How would I increase the green AP?
    - First option, you can level up your commander rank
    - Second option, you can buy characters. Each character you add to your roster adds 5 AP each.

9. End
